# Climbing self-assessment

This Angular app is a rock climbing skills self-assessment, based on the book
'Training for Climbing' by Eric Horst. Climbers are asked to grade themselves
on a series of questions, and then given an overall score for three categories:
'Mental', 'Technique/Tactics', and 'Physical'. The goal is to identify strengths
and weaknesses so that training can be focused on the most beneficial areas.
